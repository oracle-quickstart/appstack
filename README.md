App Stack
=========

This repository has automation for various application deployments on OCI using serverless resources such as Container Instances and Autonomous Database. In the current version only Java applications are supported. 

The Container Instances service provides an ideal deployment solution because it provides full automation (serverless) and is cost effective.

# App Stack for Java

**App Stack for Java** is a customizable Terraform Stack designed to automate the deployment of Java applications in a serverless infrastructure. Follow the instructions below to learn how to utilize the stack to seamlessly deploy Java applications to Container Instances, creating a production-ready environment.

[![Deploy to Oracle Cloud](https://oci-resourcemanager-plugin.plugins.oci.oraclecloud.com/latest/deploy-to-oracle-cloud.svg)](https://cloud.oracle.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?zipUrl=https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/appstack/releases/download/v0.1.0/appstackforjava.zip) 

![Blueprint architecture](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/appstack/blob/main/images/blueprintarchitecture.svg)

You can provide your Java application through 3 mechanisms:
1. The **source code**: this is the most valuable use case. Your source code can be in a github repo and mirrored in OCI DevOps (see details below). The stack will create a build pipeline that:
    - Builds a container image of your application using your build instructions (for example 'mvn install'). The container image uses JDK17 to run your application.
    - Automatically deploys new versions of the git branch you have chosen during the configuration.
2. An **artifact (JAR or WAR)**: the stack configures the JDBC DataSource for the chosen Database and creates a build pipeline that:
    - Builds a container image of your application by either executing the Jar (JDK17 is used) or deploying the War in Tomcat 9.
    - Automatically deploys new versions of the artifact.
3. A **container image**: your application is already packaged in a *container image* published in the container registry.

In all cases the deployment is done on Container Instances behind a load balancer.

## Release
 - v0.1.0: Initial release as a preview.

## Prerequisites

For deploying your Java App with the App Stack, here is the list of OCI prerequisites.

- **DevOps project:** A Java application in a DevOps project (can be a mirror of an existing GitHub repo). This isn't required if the application is provided as a container image. Note that the repo in OCI DevOps can be a mirror of a repo in GitHub.
- **Vault:** A new user in IAM (<application_name>-user) is created and his token needed to connect to the DevOps repo is stored in the vault. When the stack is destroyed this user is dropped. This is needed because there is a limit on the number of tokens a user can have. Therefore we donâ€™t want to use the current user. This isn't required if the application is provided as a container image.
- **DNS:** A DNS zone to create the application URL (for example https://myapp.domain.com). If not provided during the stack configuration, the application will be available through the load balancer's public IP. You can then configure your third-party DNS provider to point to this IP address.
- **HTTPS certificate:** is needed for the load balancer. If no certificate is provided, HTTP will be used against the IP address.
- **Database:** an existing ADB can be used with the stack. An option is also provided to make the stack create one if needed.

## Which Cloud Resources will be used?

- **Container Instances** to run the app. This is not part of the always-free resources but can be used with free credits.
- **ADB-S** for persistence. An existing always-free ADB-S can be used with the stack. The stack can also create one if the option is chosen.
- **APM** for monitoring. The always-free offer can be used until the limit is reached. The stack has a checkbox to specify that *always free* should be used.
- **Load Balancer** for scalability.  The *always-free* offer can be used until the limit is reached.
- **DevOps** for the build pipeline and CI/CD. This is not part of the always-free resources because it uses Container Instances under the covers.
- **Vault** for enhanced security. The *always-free* offer can be used until the limit is reached.
- **Certificates** for HTTPS. The *always-free* offer can be used until the limit is reached.
- **DNS** for application URL. This is not part of the *always-free* resources.


## Usage Instructions

### Configuration

#### Application

This section describes the application to deploy and how to deploy it. The stack allows different types of deployments: *source code* deployment, java *artifact* deployment or *container image* deployment. Each type of deployment has different prerequisites and requires different parameters. *Source code* deployment is possible if the *source code* of the application is stored in OCI DevOps (note that you can mirror repositories from other sources like GitHub to OCI DevOps); Java *artifact* deployment requires a Java *artifact* to be present if the OCI *artifact* Registry; and *container image* deployment requires the *container image* to the present in an OCI Container Registry accessible by the Stack, the image must be configured to respond to HTTPS requests through the exposed port.

- **Application Name:** application identifier, this name will be used as a prefix to some of the resources created by the stack (special characters should be avoided)
- **Number of deployments:** this is the number of container instances that will be deployed, each container instance will run the application behind a firewall
- **Application source:** source code, *artifact*, or container registry 
  - If the *application source* is either *source code* or artifact:
    - **Artifact type:**
       - JAR: If your application is packaged as an executable Java Archive. The java archive will be run with the *JVM options* and *Program arguments* provided in the "Other parameters" section.
       - WAR: If your application is packaged as a Web Archive. The WAR will be deployed in a Tomcat Server. This Tomcat Server will be started using the JVM Options provided in the "Other Parameters" section.

  - If the *application source* is *source code*: 
       - **DevOps repository name (OCID):** OCID of the repository containing the *source code* of the application
       - **Branch used for build/deployment:** name of the branch to build a deploy. A build trigger will be added so that the application is built and deployed each time a change is made to this branch.
       - **Application build command:** command used to build the application. This command will be used by the build pipeline to build the application.
       - **Artifact path:** The path to the generated application *artifact* (jar or war file) after the build command has run.
  - If the *application source* is an *artifact*:
       - **Artifact repository OCID:** OCID of the repository containing the artifact
       - **Artifact OCID:** OCID of the *artifact* to deploy
  - If the *application source* is a *container image*:
       - **Full path to the image in the container registry**
       - **Exposed port:** port exposed by the container image

#### Database
The stack assumes that the persistence is handled by a database and this section lets you configure that database. You can either choose an existing database or create a new one. If you create a new one it will be configured by the stack so that the application can connect to it using network security groups and a private endpoint. If you choose an existing database, you need to configure the network access for the application. For example, if an Autonomous Database Serverless is chosen, access from the application may require either a private endpoint or an ACL rule. 

 - Use existing database:
   - **Autonomous Database:** this drop-down field lists all autonomous databases in the selected compartment. Select the database you want the application to access.
   - **DB Username:** provide the username that the application should use to access the database
   - **DB user password:** provide the user's password
 - Create a new database:
   - **Autonomous Database display name:** the user-friendly display name of the autonomous database
   - **Database ADMIN password:** password of the ADMIN user of the database
   - **Storage (TB):** The amount of storage in TB to allocate.
   - **OCPU count:** The number of OCPU cores to enable. Available cores are subject to your tenancy's service limits.

If the application consumes environment variables to configure the database access, the stack can set these environment variables so that the application will connect to the selected database. If the *application source* is either *source code* or *artifact*, the stack will configure the application to use mutual TLS when connecting to the database. In order to do so, the stack will download the wallet of the selected database, it will then store the username and password used to access the database in it (Secure External Password Store wallet). This wallet can then be provided to the application using the TNS_ADMIN environment variable. In the *application source* is a *container image*, the image must contain the SEPS wallet required to estblish the connection to the DB.

If you are deploying the application from either *source code* or *artifact*, the stack will always add the wallet that includes the database credentials to the image it generates and set the TNS_ADMIN environment variable to point to it. Therefore the only configuration parameter needed to connect to the database is the connection URL that can be set through an environment variable whose name is configurable. A check box will allow you to choose if you want to use an environment variable to set the connection URL and if you check that checkbox you will be prompted for the environment variable's name.

 - **Set connection URL environment variable:** check this checkbox if your application can consume an environment variable to configure the URL.
   - **Connection URL environment variable name:** name of the environment variable the stack will set the database connection URL to.

If you are deploying the application using a *container image*, three environment variables will be available to you, use the checkboxes to enable the use of environment variables and the text fields to provide the environment variable names.

 - **Set connection URL environment variable:** check this checkbox if your application can consume an environment variable to configure the URL.
   - **Connection URL environment variable name:** name of the environment variable the stack will set the database connection URL to.
 - **Set username environment variable:** check this checkbox if your application can consume an environment variable to configure the database username (available only if the *application source* is image).
   - **Database user environment variable name:** name of the environment variable the stack will set the database username to.
 - **Set password environment variable:** check this checkbox if your application can consume an environment variable to configure the database username (available only if the *application source* is an image).
   - **Database user's password environment variable name:** name of the environment variable the stack will set the database user's password to.

**Other Parameters:** Besides the above-predefined environment variables, the stack allows you to provide other parameters to your application. This can be achieved by providing environment variables, JVM options, and/or program arguments. The use of the JVM option is possible when the *application source* is either *source code* or *artifact*, and the use of program arguments is only possible when the *artifact* type is JAR.

 - **Other environment variables:** If your application consumes environment variables, you can use this field to set these environment variables. Environment variables should be provided as a semicolon-separated list of <name, value> pairs in the following format: var1=value1;var2=value2 ... varN=valueN. These environment variables will then be set on the container instances.
 - **JVM options:** You can also provide JVM options that will be set when starting the Java VM. If the *artifact* type of your application is a JAR, the JVM Options will be set when starting the JAR file and if the *artifact* type is a WAR, the JVM Options will be set when starting Tomcat. All types of JVM options are allowed.
   - Standard options for example a system property: -DmySystemProperty=myValue
   - Non-Standard options for example setting how much memory will be allocated for your JVM: -Xms1g -Xmx8g
 - **Program arguments:** If your application consumes arguments, you can use this field to set them. Arguments should be provided as a space-separated list and will be passed to the application at start-up : arg1  arg2 ..., argN.

**Application configuration - SSL communication between backends and load balancer:** A certificate is needed to configure the load balancer and the backends so that the communication between them is done using SSL. If the *application source* is either *source code* or *artifact*, the stack will create this certificate, if the *application source* is a *container image* it is required for the *container image* to be configured using a certificate and that this certificate is provided so that the stack can configure the load balancer accordingly.

If the *application source* is either *source code* or *artifact*, the stack creates the self-signed certificate that will be used for the communication between the load balancer and the backends. This self-signed certificate is stored in a JKS keystore. If the *artifact* type is a WAR (web application deployed using Tomcat) Tomcat will be configured to use this keystore. If the *artifact* type is JAR the stack can use properties to configure SSL for the application. By default, Spring boot properties will be used by the stack. A checkbox allows to change that configuration.

 - **Server port number property name:** Assuming that your application can consume a property to configure the server port, this field can be used to specify the name of the property.
 - **SSL keystore filename property name:** Assuming that your application can consume a property to configure the SSL keystore filename, this field can be used to specify the name of the property.
 - **SSL key alias property name:** Assuming that your application can consume a property to configure the SSL key alias property name, this field can be used to specify the name of the property.
 - **SSL keystore password property name:** Assuming that your application can consume a property to configure the SSL keystore password property name, this field can be used to specify the name of the property.
 - **SSL keystore type property name:** Assuming that your application can consume a property to configure the SSL keystore type property name, this field can be used to specify the name of the property.

If the *application source* is a *container image*, the image must be configured to use SSL, the following information is necessary to configure the load balancer:

 - **SSL certificate:** The public certificate (PEM format)
 - **Private key:** The certificate's private key (PEM format)
 - **CA certificate:** The CA certificate (PEM format, same as the certificate for self-signed certificates)


#### Vault
A Vault is used to store sensitive information such as authentication tokens and passwords. The stack can either use an existing vault (which can be in a different compartment) or create a new one.

To use an existing key vault :

 - **Compartment:** select the compartment containing the vault
 - **Vault:** select the vault you would like to use
 - **Encryption key:** select a AES encryption key to use

To create a new vault:

 - **Key vault display name:** user-friendly name of the vault to create. The vault will be created in the same compartment as the rest of the resources created by the stack.

#### Application URL:

This is optional but if you have a DNS domain that's managed in OCI you can configure the stack to add a new record (hostname) for your application. A certificate will also be needed so that the application can be accessed through HTTPS.

 - **DNS zone:** Domain name in which the hostname will be created.
 - **Hostname:** The hostname will be created on the selected Zone and will resolve to the load balancer's IP address.
 - **Certificate OCID:** certificate for the application URL

#### Network

The stack is designed to create all of its resources in the same VCN. It uses three subnets:
1. The application subnet which contains the container instances running the application and the container instances running the deployment pipelines;
2. The database subnet which contains the database if it is created by the stack and
3. The load balancer subnet which contains the load balancer.

The application and database subnets are private subnets, the load balancer subnet can be either a private or a public subnet depending on whether the load balancer should be accessible from the internet or not. 

You can either create a new VCN by providing its CIDR blocks:

 - **VCN IPv4 CIDR Blocks:** IP address range of the Virtual Cloud Network

Or use an existing VCN by choosing the compartment containing the VCN and selecting the VCN from the drop-down list:

 - **The compartment of the existing VCN:** select the compartment of the existing VCN you want to use
 - **Select to VCN:** select the existing VCN to be used

The application subnet will contain the container instances running the application and will also be used by the deployment pipeline. A Network Security Group will be created with ingress rules that allow the load balancer to access the application on its exposed port and egress rules that allow the application to connect to the database and other OCI Services through a Service Gateway.  If you use an existing VCN, you have the choice between using an existing subnet for the application subnet or creating a new one. If you chose to use and existing application subnet you should make sure that the subnet configuration does not prevent the application from accessing the database and other OCI Services and also does not prevent the load balancer form accessing the application on the exposed port.

 - Create a new application subnet
   - **Application Subnet IPv4 CIDR Blocks:** IP address range of the Application subnet. This range should be a subset of the VCN subnet and should not overlap with the other subnets in the VCN. Container instances running the application and deploy pipeline will use this subnet.
 - Use existing application subnet
   - **Select the application subnet:** Container instances running the application and deploy pipeline will use this subnet. This list will only contain private subnets.

A database subnet is only needed if the Stack creates a new database, as only the database will be created in this subnet. A Network Security Group will be created with ingress rules that allow the application to connect to the database. If you use an existing VCN, you have the choice between using an existing subnet for the database or creating a new one. If you chose to use an existing database subnet you should make sure that the subnet configuration does not prevent the application from accessing the database.

 - Create a new database subnet
   - **Database Subnet Creation:** IPv4 CIDR Blocks: IP address range of the Database subnet. This range should be a subset of the VCN subnet and should not overlap with the other subnets in the VCN. The Autonomous Database will be created using this subnet.
 - Use existing database subnet
   - **Select the database subnet:** The Autonomous Database will be created using this subnet. This list will only contain private subnets.

The load balancer subnet can either be a private or a public subnet. Resources in a private subnet can only have private IP addresses and are only accessible from inside OCI; while resources in a public subnet can have both private and public IP addresses and are accessible from both OCI and the Internet. A Network Security Group will be created with an ingress rule that allows access to the load balancer, and an egress rule that allows the load balancer to access the application. If you choose to open the load balancer to the Internet, the load balancer subnet will be a public subnet, and an Internet Gateway will be created. If you are using an existing VCN you can choose to use an existing load balancer subnet or create a new one. The choice of existing load balancer subnet (private or public) should be consistent with whether you want to open access to the load balancer from the Internet or not.

 - Create a new load balancer subnet
   - **Load Balancer Subnet IPv4 CIDR Blocks:** IP address range of the Load Balancer subnet. This range should be a subset of the VCN subnet and should not overlap with the other subnets in the VCN. The Load Balancer will use this subnet.
 - Use existing load balancer subnet
   - **Select the load balancer subnet:** The Load Balancer will be created using this subnet. This list will contain both public and private subnets. Note that if a private subnet is chosen, the Load Balancer will not have a public IP address and will therefore not be directly accessible from the Internet.
 - **Open load balancer's HTTPS port:** By checking this checkbox you agree to make the load balancer subnet public and to open the HTTPS port of the load balancer to the Internet.

By default the load balancer is configured with a minimum and maximum bandwidth of 10Mbps, the health check URL is set to "/" and the status code 200. These values can be changed if needed.

 - **Maximum bandwidth (Mbps):** 10Mbps for always free load balancer
 - **Minimum bandwidth (Mbps):** 10Mbps for always free load balancer
 - **URL path (URI):** This url will be used by the health checker to verify that the application is running
 - **Status code:** Status code returned by the health checker URL when the application is running

#### Container instance configuration

Finally you can choose the shape and size of the container instances that will run your application.

 - **Container instance shape:** A shape is a template that determines the number of OCPUs, amount of memory, and other resources that are allocated to a container instance.
 - **Memory (GB):** Memory configuration for the container instance
 - **OCPU:** Number of OCPU for the container instance.

### What will the stack do?

 - Create a new repository called "<application-name>_config" that includes:
   - **wallet.zip:** The database wallet (the zip that includes tnsnames.ora, cwallet.sso and ojdbc.properties) If the database wallet is rotated this zip file needs to be updated.
   - **Dockerfile:** used to build the container image
   - **build_spec.yaml:** build spec for the build pipeline
   - **self.keystore:** self-signed keystore for the internal https connection between the load balancer and the container instances
   - **orapki.jar:** used by the build pipeline to add the db password to cwallet.sso.
 - Generate a *container image* of the user's application, including an HTTP/HTTPS server and pre-configured ADB access
 - Add the generated image to the Container Registry
 - Deploy the application as a container in **Container Instances**
   - leverage OCI services such as VCN, Object stores 
 - Terraform script for provisioning the Autonomous Database
 - Dependencies to pull JDBC, UCP, R2DBC, and so on from Maven  Central. 

## Destroying the stack

Before you can destroy the stack and all the resources that have been created you must manually delete the artifact that the stack has created under the "Stack registry".
