<p>It supports the following cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>application&#39;s source code</strong> is available in DevOps and the stack will build the application
    before creating a container;</li>
  <li>The <strong>application is packaged in a war</strong> (web application archive) and the stack will build the
    container with a Tomcat runtime;</li>
  <li>The <strong>application is packaged in a jar</strong> and the stack will build the container and execute the jar
    directly;</li>
  <li>The <strong>application is packaged in a container image</strong> and the stack will use that image for the
    container.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases you can configure how many instances of the application will be launched in Container Instances. The
  stack will start the load balancer in front of these instances. The stack also configures the application to be
  monitored using Application Performance Monitoring.</p>

<p>JDK 17 and Tomcat 9 are used.</p>
